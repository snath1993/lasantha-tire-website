           PROJECT INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS (WinRAR SFX)
========================================================================

Since I cannot create the .exe file directly (I don't have WinRAR installed here),
you need to create the Self-Extracting (SFX) archive yourself.

Follow these steps:

1.  **Prepare the Folder:**
    -   Go to `c:\whatsapp-sql-api`
    -   Ensure all your files are there.
    -   (Optional) Download the Node.js installer (e.g., node-v18-x64.msi) and put it in a new folder named `tools`.

2.  **Open WinRAR:**
    -   Select all files in `c:\whatsapp-sql-api`.
    -   Right-click -> "Add to archive..."

3.  **General Tab:**
    -   Check "Create SFX archive".
    -   Archive name: `WhatsAppBotSetup.exe`

4.  **Advanced Tab -> SFX Options:**
    -   **General (Tab):**
        -   Path to extract: `C:\whatsapp-sql-api` (or leave blank to ask user)
        -   "Absolute path" (if you set C:\...)
        -   *Setup program > Run after extraction:* `deploy\install.bat`
    -   **Modes (Tab):**
        -   Check "Unpack to temporary folder" (ONLY if you want it temp, but usually for this project you want it PERMANENT).
        -   BETTER: Uncheck "Unpack to temp", and set the extract path to `C:\ProjectName`.
        -   Silent mode: "Hide all" (if you want fully silent) or "Display all".
    -   **Advanced (Tab):**
        -   Check "Request administrative access" (Important for Service installation).

5.  **Click OK -> OK.**

6.  **Result:**
    -   You will get a `WhatsAppBotSetup.exe`.
    -   When you run it on the client PC, it will:
        1. Extract the files.
        2. Automatically run `deploy\install.bat`.
        3. Install dependencies and register the service.
